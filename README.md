## Origin
The photons color scheme is of my own creation. Rest are from gnachman's repo. Most of the themes were converted  from [n0tch2k](http://n0tch2k.deviantart.com/)'s [.Xdefaults](http://rawtec.de/dotfiles/Xdefaults.html) by using `tools/xresources_to_iterm` (reads an `.Xresources` color scheme from *stdin* and writes an iTerm2 theme to *stdout*).

## Update
I'm moved to a **non proprietary** working environment lately: this repository is frozen. Please check out my other projects.
